# Pomodro Clock 🚀

## The 25+5 clock is a time management tool used to enhance productivity through the Pomodoro Technique. It involves working for 25 minutes, followed by a 5-minute break. After completing four cycles, a longer break is taken. This method helps maintain focus and prevent burnout by breaking work into manageable intervals.📝

```javascript
const App = () => (
  <div>
    <BreakControls />
    <SessionControls />
    <Timer />
    <h1 className="name">Designed and Coded By Elhamy</h1>
  </div>
);
```
